# ERC20

ERC20 is a widely adopted standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. However, ERC20 doesn't have payable functions for tokens. For example, if someone wants to swap DAI to ETH, he/she has to approve infinte DAI and then make a separate transaction to swap it. There has been several new standards introduced to fix this problem. One of them being ERC777.

# ERC777

It provides advance features to interact with tokens:

1. Operators are allowed to send/burn tokens on behalf of the user
2. send/receive hooks to offer token holder more control over their tokens.

ERC777 makes use of several other ERCs like:

1. ERC1820 - It has superseeded ERC820 and defines a universal registry where any address can register the interfaces it supports.
2. ERC165 - Creates a standard method to publish and detect what interfaces a smart contract implements.

Benefits:

1. It adds payable functions for tokens.
2. ERC777 + Contract Wallets would remove the issue of Spam tokes by rejecting unwanted tokens.

Issues:

1. ERC777 hooks open up the issues of reentrancy attack. We have witnessed a few hacks in the past due to this. It is suggested to use reentreancy guards.
2. OZ will be depreciating its support shortly.

Other viable options:

1. ERC2612 - This ERC extends the ERC20 standard with a new function 'permit' which allows users to modify the allowance mapping using a signed message instead of message sender.
2. ERC4524 - This standard extends ERC20 tokens with ERC165 and adds familiar functions from ERC721 and ERC1155 ensuring receiving contracts have implemented proper functionality.
3. ERC1363

# ERC1363

It defines a token interface for ERC20 tokens that supports executing recipient code after 'transfer' or 'transferFrom', or spender code after 'approve'. It has three main functions:

1. transferAndCall - This is from a msg.sender and triggers onTransferReceived on a ERC1363Receiver contract.
2. transferFromAndCall - This is from other contract and triggers onTransferReceived on a ERC1363Receiver contract.
3. approveAndCall - This triggers onApprovalReceived on a ERC1363Spender contract.

Although there's one problem that ERC1363 still doesn't solve. One of it is the approve race condition as it happens with ERC20. It is suggested to first set the allowance to or use SafeERC20 methods.
